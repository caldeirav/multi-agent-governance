      "\n",
      "The internet's origins are rooted in the Cold War era of the 1950s when the U.S. realized the need for a communication system resilient to nuclear attacks. This led to the development of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in the 1960s, which allowed government researchers to share information. ARPANET officially adopted the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, marking the birth of the internet as we know it. The Internet Society highlights ARPANET's crucial role in supporting various research programs, leading to the evolution of the Network Working Group into the Internet Working Group.\n",

This innovation transformed the internet from a simple file-sharing system into a \"web\" of linked information accessible to anyone. The introduction of web browsers further popularized the internet in the late 1990s, leading to the \"dotcom bubble\" and the rise of e-commerce.\n",
