    "# Multi-Agent Report Generation with AgentWorkflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use an `AgentWorkflow` in LlamaIndex to create multi-agent systems. Specifically, we will create a system that can generate a report on a given topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we leverage both local serving of a `qwen3-8b` Small Language Model (SLM) as our LLM, served by LM Studio, and a state-of-the-art model `gemini-2.5-flash` hosted by Google Cloud. For all supported LLM inference providers and models by LlamaIndex, check out the [examples documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/openai/) or [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/?tab=llms) for a list of all supported LLMs and how to install/use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we wanted, each agent could have a different LLM, but for this example, we will use the same LLM for all agents."

The true explosion of public access and utility, however, came with the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989, which introduced user-friendly hyperlinks and browsers, transforming a complex network into an accessible information superhighway. From there, commercialization in the 1990s led to widespread adoption, evolving from a niche academic tool into the ubiquitous platform for communication, commerce, and information that defines modern life.\n"

       "[(\"There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available information infrastructure.\\n\\nThe Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological, organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community operations.\\n\\n## 2. ORIGINS OF THE INTERNET\\n\\nThe first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his 'Galactic Network' concept [9]. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research program at DARPA 5 , starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.\\n\\nLeonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 [6] and the first book on the subject in 1964 [7]. Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers talk together. To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built [10]. The result of this experiment was the realization that the timeshared computers could work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job. Kleinrock's argument for packet switching was confirmed.\\n\\n5 The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) changed its name to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1971, then back to ARPA in 1993, and back to DARPA in 1996. We refer throughout to DARPA, the current name.\\n\\nIn late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put together his plan for the 'ARPANET', publishing it in 1967 [11]. At the conference where he presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept from the UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in 1964 [1]. It happened that the work at MIT (19611967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other work. The word 'packet' was adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps 6 .\\n\\nIn August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches called Interface Message Processors (IMP's). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on the IMP's with Bob Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the network topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the network measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock's team at UCLA 7 .\\n\\nDue to Kleinrock's early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design and measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first node on the ARPANET.\",\n",

It was written at the urging of its primary editor, the late Barry Leiner. He felt that a factual rendering of the events and activities associated with the development of the early Internet would be a valuable contribution. The contributing authors did their best to incorporate only factual material into this document. There are sure to be many details that have not been captured in the body of the document but it remains one of the most accurate renderings of the early period of development available.\\n\\n## Categories and Subject Descriptors\\n\\nC.2.1 [ Network Architecture and Design ]: Packet-switching networks.\\n\\n## General Terms\\n\\nDesign, Experimentation, Management.\\n\\n## Keywords\\n\\nInternet, History.\\n\\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and  computer  set  the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a\\n\\n* Deceased\\n\\n1 http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml\\n\\nworld-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location.\\n\\nThe Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like 'bleiner@computer.org'  and  'http://www.acm.org'  trip  lightly off  the tongue of the random person on the street 2 .\\n\\nThis is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written about the Internet 3 .\\n\\nIn this paper 4 , several of us involved in the development and evolution of the Internet share our views of its origins and history.\\n\\n- 2 Perhaps this is an exaggeration based on the lead author's residence in Silicon Valley.\\n- 3 On a recent trip to a Tokyo bookstore, one of the authors counted 14 English language magazines devoted to the Internet.\\n- 4 An abbreviated version of this article appears in the 50th anniversary issue of the CACM , Feb. 97. The authors would like to express their appreciation to Andy Rosenbloom, CACM Senior Editor, for both instigating the writing of this article and his invaluable assistance in editing both this and the abbreviated version.\\n\\nVolume 39, Number 5, October 2009\\n\\nThis history revolves around four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher level functionality. There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available information infrastructure.\\n\\nThe Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological, organizational, and community.

And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community operations.\\n\\n## 2. ORIGINS OF THE INTERNET\\n\\nThe first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his 'Galactic Network' concept [9]. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research program at DARPA 5 , starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.\\n\\nLeonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 [6] and the first book on the subject in 1964 [7]. Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers talk together. To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built [10]. The result of this experiment was the realization that the timeshared computers could work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job. Kleinrock's argument for packet switching was confirmed.\\n\\n5 The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) changed its name to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1971, then back to ARPA in 1993, and back to DARPA in 1996. We refer throughout to DARPA, the current name.\\n\\nIn late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put together his plan for the 'ARPANET', publishing it in 1967 [11]. At the conference where he presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept from the UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in 1964 [1]. It happened that the work at MIT (19611967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other work. The word 'packet' was adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps 6 .\\n\\nIn August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches called Interface Message Processors (IMP's). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on the IMP's with Bob Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the network topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the network measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock's team at UCLA 7 .\\n\\nDue to Kleinrock's early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design and measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first node on the ARPANET.\",\n",

There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure.

       " (\"In October 1972 Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial 'hot' application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of 'people-to-people' traffic.\\n\\n## 3. THE INITIAL INTERNETTING CONCEPTS\\n\\nThe original ARPANET grew into the Internet. Internet was based on the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary design, beginning with the ARPANET as the pioneering packet switching network, but soon to include packet satellite networks, ground-based packet radio networks and other networks. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level 'Internetworking Architecture'. Up until that time there was only one general method for federating networks. This was the traditional circuit switching method where networks would interconnect at the circuit level, passing individual bits on a synchronous basis along a portion of an end-to-end circuit between a pair of end locations. Recall that Kleinrock had shown in 1961 that packet switching was a more efficient switching method. Along with packet switching, special purpose interconnection arrangements between networks were another possibility. While there were other limited ways to interconnect different networks, they required that one be used as a component of the other, rather than acting as a peer of the other in offering end-to-end service.\\n\\nIn an open-architecture network, the individual networks may be separately designed and developed and each may have its own unique interface which it may offer to users and/or other providers. including other Internet providers. Each network can be designed in accordance with the specific environment and user requirements of that network. There are generally no constraints on the types of network that can be included or on their geographic scope, although certain pragmatic considerations will dictate what makes sense to offer.\\n\\nThe idea of open-architecture networking was first introduced by Kahn shortly after having arrived at DARPA in 1972. This work was originally part of the packet radio program, but subsequently became a separate program in its own right. At the time, the program was called 'Internetting'. Key to making the packet radio system work was a reliable end-end protocol that could maintain effective communication in the face of jamming and other radio interference, or withstand intermittent blackout such as caused by being in a tunnel or blocked by the local terrain. Kahn first contemplated developing a protocol local only to the packet radio network, since that would avoid having to deal with the multitude of different operating systems, and continuing to use NCP.\\n\\nHowever, NCP did not have the ability to address networks (and machines) further downstream than a destination IMP on the ARPANET and thus some change to NCP would also be required. (The assumption was that the ARPANET was not changeable in this regard). NCP relied on ARPANET to provide end-to-end reliability. If any packets were lost, the protocol (and presumably any applications it supported) would come to a grinding halt. In this model NCP had no end-end host error control, since the ARPANET was to be the only network in existence and it would be so reliable that no error control would be required on the part of the hosts.\\n\\nThus, Kahn decided to develop a new version of the protocol which could meet the needs of an open-architecture network environment. This protocol would eventually be called the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). While NCP tended to act like a device driver, the new protocol would be more like a communications protocol.\\n\\nFour ground rules were critical to Kahn's early thinking:\\n\\n- · Each distinct network would have to stand on its own and  no  internal  changes  could  be  required  to  any  such network to connect it to the Internet.\\n- · Communications would be on a best effort basis.\",\n",

ORIGINS OF THE INTERNET\\n\\nThe first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his 'Galactic Network' concept [9]. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research program at DARPA 5 , starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.\\n\\nLeonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 [6] and the first book on the subject in 1964 [7]. Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers talk together. To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built [10]. The result of this experiment was the realization that the timeshared computers could work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job. Kleinrock's argument for packet switching was confirmed.\\n\\n5 The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) changed its name to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1971, then back to ARPA in 1993, and back to DARPA in 1996. We refer throughout to DARPA, the current name.\\n\\nIn late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put together his plan for the 'ARPANET', publishing it in 1967 [11]. At the conference where he presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept from the UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in 1964 [1]. It happened that the work at MIT (19611967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other work. The word 'packet' was adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps 6 .\\n\\nIn August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches called Interface Message Processors (IMP's). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on the IMP's with Bob Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the network topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the network measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock's team at UCLA 7 .\\n\\nDue to Kleinrock's early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design and measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first node on the ARPANET.\", \"## A Brief History of the Internet\\n\\nBarry M.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and  computer  set  the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a\\n\\n* Deceased\\n\\n1 http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml\\n\\nworld-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location.\\n\\nThe Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like 'bleiner@computer.org'  and  'http://www.acm.org'  trip  lightly off  the tongue of the random person on the street 2 .\\n\\nThis is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written about the Internet 3 .\\n\\nIn this paper 4 , several of us involved in the development and evolution of the Internet share our views of its origins and history.\\n\\n- 2 Perhaps this is an exaggeration based on the lead author's residence in Silicon Valley.\\n- 3 On a recent trip to a Tokyo bookstore, one of the authors counted 14 English language magazines devoted to the Internet.\\n- 4 An abbreviated version of this article appears in the 50th anniversary issue of the CACM , Feb. 97.

There is the technological evolution that began with early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher level functionality. There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available information infrastructure.\\n\\nThe Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological, organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community operations.\\n\\n## 2. ORIGINS OF THE INTERNET\\n\\nThe first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R.\", \"In October 1972 Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial 'hot' application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of 'people-to-people' traffic.\\n\\n## 3. THE INITIAL INTERNETTING CONCEPTS\\n\\nThe original ARPANET grew into the Internet. Internet was based on the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary design, beginning with the ARPANET as the pioneering packet switching network, but soon to include packet satellite networks, ground-based packet radio networks and other networks. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level 'Internetworking Architecture'. Up until that time there was only one general method for federating networks. This was the traditional circuit switching method where networks would interconnect at the circuit level, passing individual bits on a synchronous basis along a portion of an end-to-end circuit between a pair of end locations. Recall that Kleinrock had shown in 1961 that packet switching was a more efficient switching method. Along with packet switching, special purpose interconnection arrangements between networks were another possibility. While there were other limited ways to interconnect different networks, they required that one be used as a component of the other, rather than acting as a peer of the other in offering end-to-end service.\\n\\nIn an open-architecture network, the individual networks may be separately designed and developed and each may have its own unique interface which it may offer to users and/or other providers. including other Internet providers. Each network can be designed in accordance with the specific environment and user requirements of that network. There are generally no constraints on the types of network that can be included or on their geographic scope, although certain pragmatic considerations will dictate what makes sense to offer.\\n\\nThe idea of open-architecture networking was first introduced by Kahn shortly after having arrived at DARPA in 1972. This work was originally part of the packet radio program, but subsequently became a separate program in its own right. At the time, the program was called 'Internetting'. Key to making the packet radio system work was a reliable end-end protocol that could maintain effective communication in the face of jamming and other radio interference, or withstand intermittent blackout such as caused by being in a tunnel or blocked by the local terrain. Kahn first contemplated developing a protocol local only to the packet radio network, since that would avoid having to deal with the multitude of different operating systems, and continuing to use NCP.\\n\\nHowever, NCP did not have the ability to address networks (and machines) further downstream than a destination IMP on the ARPANET and thus some change to NCP would also be required. (The assumption was that the ARPANET was not changeable in this regard). NCP relied on ARPANET to provide end-to-end reliability. If any packets were lost, the protocol (and presumably any applications it supported) would come to a grinding halt. In this model NCP had no end-end host error control, since the ARPANET was to be the only network in existence and it would be so reliable that no error control would be required on the part of the hosts.\\n\\nThus, Kahn decided to develop a new version of the protocol which could meet the needs of an open-architecture network environment. This protocol would eventually be called the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). While NCP tended to act like a device driver, the new protocol would be more like a communications protocol.\\n\\nFour ground rules were critical to Kahn's early thinking:\\n\\n- · Each distinct network would have to stand on its own and  no  internal  changes  could  be  required  to  any  such network to connect it to the Internet.\\n- · Communications would be on a best effort basis.\"]\n",

The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Another catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet.

      "The story of the internet begins in the mid-20th century, amidst the geopolitical tensions of the Cold War. The United States military, concerned about maintaining communication lines in the event of a nuclear attack, sought to create a decentralized and resilient communication system. This initiative led to the development of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in the 1960s. ARPANET was the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite, a foundational technology that remains central to the internet's operation today. The official transition to the TCP/IP protocol on January 1, 1983, is widely regarded as the birth of the modern internet.\n",

      "While the internet provided the underlying infrastructure, it was the invention of the World Wide Web that made it accessible and useful to a broader audience. In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN, proposed a system for managing and linking information. He developed the core technologies that form the basis of the web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for creating documents, the first web browser (named WorldWideWeb), the first web server, and the world's first website, which went live on December 20, 1990. To promote open standards and guide the web's development, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994.\n",

The widespread adoption of broadband internet access fueled the rise of social media platforms like MySpace and LinkedIn, and collaborative content creation tools such as Wikipedia and WordPress. This era has been defined by transformative technological shifts, most notably the advent of cloud computing, which allows for remote data storage and processing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects everyday objects to the network. The internet's evolution continues at a rapid pace, driven by emerging technologies like 5G, Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, Big Data analytics, and virtual reality, all of which promise to further reshape our world.\n",
